# ReaxFF Reactive Force Field for the Y-Doped BaZrO3 Proton Conductor with Applications to Diffusion Rates for Multigranular Systems
(J. Phys. Chem. A 2008, 112, 11414â€“11422)
* In this paper, the authors have calculated BaZrO3 with force field MD, and got some results about graind boundary.
* H diffusion at grain boundary is slow.[1]
* Force field MD has some limitation in its accuracy.
